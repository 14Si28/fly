This repo is dedicated to autonomus flying vehicle.

Drone technology and future flying cars will use this as the base doc.

## FCND - Backyard Flyer Project
In this project, you'll set up a state machine using event-driven programming to autonomously flying a drone. You will be using flying a quadcopter in Unity simulator. After completing this assignment, you'll be familiar with sending commands and receiving incoming data from the drone.

The python code you write is similar to how the drone would be controlled from a ground station computer or an onboard flight computer. Since communication with the drone is done using MAVLink, you will be able to use your code to control an PX4 quadcopter autopilot with very little modification!

## FCND - 3D Motion Planning

This project is a continuation of the Backyard Flyer project where you executed a simple square shaped flight path. In this project you will integrate the techniques that you have learned throughout the last several lessons to plan a path through an urban environment. Check out the project rubric for more detail on what constitutes a passing submission.

## FCND-Controls-CPP
For this project, you will be building a controller in C++. You will be implementing and tuning this controller in several steps.
There are 2 parts of this project, one is in python and other is in C++,
You may find it helpful to consult the Python controller code as a reference when you build out this controller in C++.

## Estimation Project
Welcome to the estimation project. In this project, you will be developing the estimation portion of the controller used in the CPP simulator. By the end of the project, your simulated quad will be flying with your estimator and your custom controller (from the previous project)!
