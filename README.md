## FCND - Backyard Flyer Project
In this project, you'll set up a state machine using event-driven programming to autonomously flying a drone. You will be using flying a quadcopter in Unity simulator. After completing this assignment, you'll be familiar with sending commands and receiving incoming data from the drone.

The python code you write is similar to how the drone would be controlled from a ground station computer or an onboard flight computer. Since communication with the drone is done using MAVLink, you will be able to use your code to control an PX4 quadcopter autopilot with very little modification!


## Estimation Project
Welcome to the estimation project. In this project, you will be developing the estimation portion of the controller used in the CPP simulator. By the end of the project, your simulated quad will be flying with your estimator and your custom controller (from the previous project)!
