## Intro to vehicle control

In the case of a flying vehicle to reach to a certain altitude, if we apply some thrust (say in proportion to the altitude), it will start accelearating
in z direction and overshoots the target altitude, and if we want to come back to the same altitude we have to again 
go down and up and start occilating around the point to reach there.

To avaiod this process of occilation, we need PID controller where P, I and D stands for Proportional, Integration and differenciation.

(looks like we have to apply thrust based on the altitude remaining after continiuous integration and differentiation)


## What need a vehicle to be in the air?
A vehicle to be in the air, upward thrust equal to the vehicle body weight is not only required to maitain it in 
the air.
To maintain the vehicle in the air we need to define aur model whiche needs to manage all the troubles due to air
and around senarios.


## Perfect is impossible
We only control drone rotation rates, and these cause forces and moments of the drone, which cause translational
accelaration and rotational accelaration.
Here we can't control velocity and position hence we need to rely on accelaration.

## Error are unavoidable
There are 3 types of errors in general:
* Model error
* Disturbance
* Measurement Noise
