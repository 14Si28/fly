## Control Architecture
In 1D Dynamics We can express the vertical acceleration as -g.

v = u + at

s = ut + 1/2 att

vv = uu + 2as

In 2D, we have to take coponents of the forces acting on the body in the direction of the motion to calculate acceleration.

Component can be taken as Fcos(theta) and Fsin(theta) towards base and perpedicular respectively.
